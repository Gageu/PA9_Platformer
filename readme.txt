There are dll files in th "Dll_Files" folder that will need to be coppied over to the debug folder if the executable is to run.

Here is the link on how to set up the project properties so that the linker can find the SFML libraries, which I assume you have already
downloaded.

also, the project is written for 32-bit systems so you will have to run it in x86 mode

I appologize if this is all redundant and you know how to do all of this but you can never be too safe and it took us hours to get working originally so
i thought better safe than sorry.
